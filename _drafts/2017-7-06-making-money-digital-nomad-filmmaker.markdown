### Making money on the road

The number one question I am asked by friends, relatives, and strangers is how do I make my money. My income is a fifty-fifty split between videography and other work. However, being a remote filmmaker is a little bit trickier (it’s still not that easy to control a camera from 500 miles away), so that’s what I’m going to focus on in this article.


### Build up some clients in your home country before you leave

I persuaded some of my clients to allow me to edit their films remotely. This for me was a fairly straightforward process as we didn’t have many face to face meetings to begin with.  I worked with one videographer, who didn’t even realise I was halfway across the world, until I randomly mentioned that my weekend plan was to snorkel in Thailand.

This type of work has the obvious advantages of being consistent and very well paid.


### Let them know you’re on your way

I email tourist related businesses before I arrive. About one in twenty of these emails results in work. Legally, if you want payment you have to secure this work before you leave your country of tax residency.

However, when in a country you can still barter. For instance, I’ve stayed in some super swanky five star hotels (one of them had six pools even though we were by the ocean!), eaten for free at restaurants and barely ever paid for use of co-working spaces. To find out how I get this type of work please see the next point.


### Network

I go to exhibitions for businesses, introduce myself, ask what they do, and then explain that I make videos for businesses such as themselves. It’s both a super fun and super successful way of acquiring new business. In the space of an hour or two I’ll have picked up at least five new clients (plus a ton of freebies, I love them freebies!). I also gain a lot of cool information about the amenities and activities available to me in this new place.


### Network Again

This isn’t about going to conferences and handing out your business card, it’s simply about developing real relationships. When I first arrive in a country I email local filmmakers and ask if I can take them out for a coffee. It’s a lovely way to meet new people, learn a lot about the local filmmaking scene, and get offers of work.

Tell everyone what you do, I’ve had the most unlikely friends or even acquaintances, hook me up with jobs. Last week at a group dinner, I met someone who works at Universal, schawing! People like to help, so if you’re straight up about your skillset and passionate about what you do, then you will find people who will help you on your path.


### 6 Use social media intelligently

I am always on social media, scanning for remote editing jobs. Facebook’s my favourite for job searches, try the big remote working groups such as
- [Digital Nomad: Remote Job Opportunities](https://www.facebook.com/groups/remotejobsfordigitalnomads/ )
- [Remote Jobs Work Anywhere](https://www.facebook.com/groups/RemoteJobs1/?ref=br_rs)
- [The Remote Work Group For Digital Nomads](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1755683011319124/)

These are quite good because there aren’t too many filmmakers competing for the jobs on offer yet. Plus, I love that I can call surfing social media work!

I find smaller but active groups to very useful for securing work, For instance, the film group, [Film Oxford](https://www.facebook.com/groups/filmoxford/), is a great example of a small but active group with good quality job listings.


### E-learning courses

I’m in the middle of creating an e-learning course for Udemy, an online learning platform. The great thing about Udemy is that’s it’s totally passive income, once I’ve created the course they do all the promotions and sales and I simply collect my share of the profits.


### Know your worth

I priced myself way too low at the beginning and it meant that I was spending too much time on each project, working well into the night, every day. It was totally exhausting and I was still barely making enough to cover my food and rent.


It’s both terrifying and exciting to raise your prices, but you have to charge a realistic amount if your business is going to be sustainable. I work out how many hours I’m going to spend on the project and then give myself a fair hourly rate.


### Just go do it!

There has never been a greater opportunity to live freely. I love how moving country challenges me to try larger and more ambitious productions. I love that one week I’ll be working on an international puppetry festival, the next a super creative advert, or the next making a vlog for a five star hotel. The diversity is exhilarating.
