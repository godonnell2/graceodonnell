### Issues solved by explainer videos

You’re posting carefully considered Twitter and Facebook ads and writing perfect copy in your email campaigns but still not seeing much in terms of ROI.

You have expanded hugely the range of services, that your business can now offer to your clients,  but you are failing to communicate all these new possibilities.

If either of those scenarios resonates with you, then maybe it’s time to take a serious look at how explainer videos have been solving these same problems for years.

### The Importance of Video in Social Media
Facebook has announced itself as a video first platform. Social video generates 1200% more shares than text and image combined.

>“When it comes to potential reach, video is peerless. YouTube receives more than one billion unique visitors every month – that's more than any other channel, apart from Facebook.”

>The Guardian

### Stand Out From the Crowd
Whilst videos are growing in popularity, a lot of them are terrible. Create something unique and interesting with Falling Gracefully that makes you stand out.

>“Performance: Video ads have an average click-through rate (CTR) of 1.84%, the highest click-through rate of all digital ad formats.”

### Prestige
Do you want to build your brand’s prestige? Wow your customers with an epic video which captures the essence of what you have to offer.
 
### Promote Your Events
Get the maximum impact from your events by capturing the action with video or even live streaming.

>“Revenue growth: Video ad revenue will increase at a three-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.5% through 2016, according to our estimates. That's faster than any other medium other than mobile. And much faster than traditional online display advertising, which will only grow at a 3% annual rate. “
